            name: The BREW method, and the use of POST
            rules:
              - type: MUST
                text: A coffee pot server MUST accept both the BREW and POST method equivalently. However, the use of POST for causing actions to happen is deprecated.
                notes:
                  - POST may be a trademark for coffee, and so the BREW method has been added.

            notes:
              - No options were given for decaffeinated coffee. What's the point?

            rules:
              - type: MAY
                text: In HTCPCP, this response code MAY be returned if the operator of the coffee pot cannot comply with the Accept-Addition request.
              - type: SHOULD
                text: Unless the request was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of available coffee additions.

            name: 418 I'm a teapot
            rules:
              - type: MAY
                text: The resulting entity body MAY be short and stout.
  - id: 3
    name: The "coffee" URI scheme
    rules:
      - type: MAY
        text: However, the use of coffee-scheme in various languages MAY be interpreted as an indication of the kind of coffee produced by the coffee pot.
        notes:
          - Note that while URL scheme names are case-independent, capitalization is important for German and thus the initial "K" must be encoded.

            notes:
              - Most home network system administrators drink coffee, and are willing to accommodate the needs of tunnelling HTCPCP.
